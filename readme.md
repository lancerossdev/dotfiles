# dotfiles `~/.`

Nothing fancy here, just a collection of dotfiles that I use on my machine because I use GitHub Codespaces and sometimes, my local machine because I like to keep my dotfiles in sync.

`/scripts` - scripts to install for local machine like Ubuntu WSL.

`.zshrc` - my one and only shell configuration file.

`.aliases` - exported aliases that I use as shortcuts.
